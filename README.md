## Jäschke

In the file containg Jäschke's headers, the symbol "–" was appended to all headers for which the transcription might be erroneous, either because they contain consonants between parentheses or because they contain Sanskrit words which I was not able to reproduce.

In a few cases, the heading of a page does not correspond to the actual printed entry. Here is a list of these typos – had there been more, I believe they should have been detected by the [sorting algorithm](https://github.com/Esukhia/tibetan-sort-python) of the BDRC:
- p. 112, instead of རྒྱད་པ་ read རྒྱུད་པ་
- p. 361, instead of འཕྲང་བ་ read འཕྲེང་བ་
- p. 430, instead of ཅ་དར་ read ཙ་དར་
- p. 433, instead of གཅང་བ་ read གཙང་བ་
- p. 447, instead of ཆབ་ཆབ་ read ཚབ་ཚབ་

In one case, Jäschke does not seem to respect his own sorting order:
- p. 454, མཚའ་ལུ་ | མཚགས་ is not consistent with p. 82 for instance དགག་པ་ | […] | དགབ་པ་ | དགའ་བ་
